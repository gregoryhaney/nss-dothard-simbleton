# Dothard and Simbleton

#### This project was an exploration of filtering, transforming, organizing, sorting, and displaying collections of data with some JavaScript methods being used to perform the operations.
#### The synopsis of this project is that Doris owns a paper distribution and serices franchise of Dothard and Simbleton; she realizes that far too much of her operation is done on paper and she wants to begin building software to automate processes and eliminate waste.
#### The methods used are automatically availabe on any array in JavaScript.
